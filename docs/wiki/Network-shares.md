# Network shares

**Shares** serves volumes to Windows, macOS and Linux over SMB (Samba), the way
an Unraid share does - `\\192.168.1.245\media`.

## The first share

The first share installs Samba. It asks which address Samba answers on - one of
[your VIPs](Networking#your-vips), or the next free one - because a share needs
an address of its own on port 445. Samba is put in place before anything else,
so a share that could not be served leaves nothing behind.

The SMB server appears as `homestead-smb` in Containers, in the **Homestead**
group. Its share mappings, mounts and image are managed from **Network Shares**,
not by editing the container. Enable, stop or remove the SMB server under
**Settings → Cluster → Add-ons**. Stopping or removing it keeps every share
definition, password, PVC and file; only the server Deployment and Service are
removed. Older `samba` workloads
are migrated to `homestead-smb`; the existing SMB address is retained when the
service can be recreated.

## Making a share

A share either:

- **creates its own volume** - a size, a class, copies; or
- **publishes a volume that exists** - including one an app is using - optionally
  just one folder inside it. That is how you reach an app's appdata from your
  desktop without copying it.

Then choose **guest** (anyone on the LAN) or **private** (a username and
password), and **read-only** or **read/write**.

Samba keeps one password per user, so a second private share for the same user
reuses its password when the field is left blank, and a new password changes it
for every share that user has - the editor says so first.

## Connecting

- **Windows**: `\\<address>\<share>` in File Explorer, or **Map network drive**.
- **macOS**: Finder → Go → Connect to Server → `smb://<address>/<share>`.
- **Linux**: `smb://<address>/<share>` in the file manager, or mount with
  `mount -t cifs`.

## Changes and safety

Growing a share happens in place. Access changes restart Samba, followed in the
job tray. One Samba pod serves every share, so a change is tested first: if the
share's volume cannot be mounted, the old shares are put back and the change is
refused with the reason, rather than taking every share down.

Removing a share keeps its volume and data. Share settings are in the
`homestead-shares` ConfigMap; passwords in the `homestead-share-credentials`
Secret, and never sent back to the browser.

The Network Shares page shows the server's own address and whether its live
mappings match the saved share list. If a Kubernetes update is rejected, the
saved settings are restored so a failed share cannot reappear on the next edit.
The **Repair mapping** button reapplies the saved shares, and Homestead also
checks for drift in the background.

## Optional NFSv4 server

NFS is a **separate container** (`homestead-nfs`), not a service inside Samba.
It is off until you choose an export on a share and enable **NFSv4 network
shares** under **Settings → Cluster → Add-ons**. Each export requires a Bound
ReadWriteMany (RWX) claim and an explicit IPv4 client or CIDR; an unrestricted
export is refused. Exports default to read-only and use root squashing. Enable
write access per share only when needed. Clients mount `<VIP>:/<share>` over
NFSv4/TCP port 2049.

The NFS image needs the host's `nfs` and `nfsd` kernel support and `SYS_ADMIN`
inside its container. The node probe checks NFS server support and Homestead
labels eligible nodes automatically; the scheduler places NFS only on those
nodes. Enable `nfsd` on the intended Linux hosts and update/install the node
probe before enabling the add-on. Homestead does not load host kernel modules.

SMB uses port 445 and NFS uses 2049, so the protocols can share one IP. This
implementation uses independently placed pods, however. NFS's client allowlist
needs the real source IP and therefore Local traffic routing. Its VIP must
follow the NFS pod; a separately placed SMB pod cannot safely use that same
VIP across all supported load balancers. Homestead reserves the NFS VIP against
sharing in both directions. A combined file-server pod would allow a shared
IP in a future implementation. k3s ServiceLB alone is not suitable for this
gateway; use kube-vip with per-Service election or MetalLB.

### Recovery when a host fails

Homestead keeps a single NFS server with a stable hostname and stable export
identities. Existing numeric export identities from v2.8.157 are saved before
upgrading them, so adding or removing a preceding share does not change file
handles for the remaining exports. Disabling/reinstalling the server keeps
these identities with the share settings. Startup and readiness checks wait
for the NFS TCP listener; the VIP only serves Ready endpoints. The Deployment
requests replacement after 15 seconds of a NotReady/unreachable taint, **in
addition to** Kubernetes' node-failure detection and storage recovery time.

**Recovery checks** in Network Shares and Add-ons list eligible replacement
hosts, control-plane/etcd quorum, actual healthy replica hosts and load-balancer
prerequisites. A replica count configured as two is not sufficient: two
healthy copies on different Ready nodes are required. One control-plane host
cannot reschedule work after its own failure. Longhorn's pod deletion policy
may also make a failed-node recovery wait for intervention. The checker never
claims a tested recovery time or uninterrupted availability.

Longhorn RWX volumes already use NFS. Linux NFS re-export does **not** support
normal file-lock/delegation recovery. This gateway is for ordinary file access,
not VM disks or databases that require those guarantees. Client access can
pause during recovery and a remount may be needed. See the upstream
[NFS re-export limitations](https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/nfs/reexport.html)
and [load-balancer sharing rules](https://metallb.io/usage/#ip-address-sharing).

Before production use, test with a disposable RWX volume and a client mounted
to its share path: verify read/write checksums, restart the gateway, move it
to a different eligible node, and check access and export identity again.
A real host-loss test must also verify the storage server and VIP move while
the API and etcd retain quorum; a pod restart alone does not prove that.

Stopping or removing `homestead-nfs` deletes neither the SMB server nor share
definitions, credentials, claims or files. Removing a share itself first drops
its NFS export; the volume still remains. Homestead owns the NFS workload's
image and mounts, so change them from Network Shares and Add-ons rather than
through the generic container editor.
