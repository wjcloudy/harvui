# Containers

**Containers** lists every app you run, as cards or as rows, with its state,
address, image and update status. In Kubernetes terms each one is a
Deployment (or a StatefulSet or DaemonSet you made elsewhere); Homestead calls
them containers because that is what you think of them as.

## Deploying a container

**＋ Deploy** takes an image - `lscr.io/linuxserver/jellyfin:latest`, say - and
asks what Docker would: ports, environment variables, volumes, devices. Most
people start from the [App Store](App-Store) instead, which fills all of that in
from the app's template, or [import](Importing) one from Unraid or a Compose
file.

The form asks, in order:

- **Name and namespace.** Apps go in `lab` unless you make others under
  **Settings → Apps → Namespaces**.
- **Network.** Which ports are reachable from your LAN, and on which address:
  automatic (the next free VIP), a **Specific VIP** you picked out under
  [Networking](Networking#your-vips), or shared with other apps on one address.
  Ports that stay inside the cluster need nothing.
- **Storage.** Each path the app writes to becomes a folder in a volume: a new
  one, one that exists, a folder inside another app's volume, or a RAM disk for
  a cache. Two paths can share one volume as two folders.
- **Hardware** and **Privileges** - below.
- **Autostart.** Off leaves it stopped until you start it.

Every choice is checked before anything is made: an address already in use,
a port clash, a volume that cannot be mounted where the app will run.

## Day to day

A container's **⋯** menu has what you would expect - start, stop, restart,
logs, console, edit - and:

- **Main port** - which of its ports the card links to first, usually its web
  page.
- **Group** - put it in a group (below).
- **Placement** - where it runs (below).
- **Rename** - the Kubernetes objects are renamed with it, carefully.
- **Move** - to another namespace, or [another cluster](Moving-between-clusters).

**Edit** opens the same form as Deploy, with everything the container has now.
Storage can be restructured there: two volumes combined into folders of one, a
folder split out to its own volume. When a path moves, Homestead offers to bring
its data along - it stops the container, copies, and starts it again - and the
old volume is kept until you remove it.

## Updates

Homestead checks each container's image against its registry - by digest for
tags like `latest`, by version for tags like `1.2.3` - and shows a pill on the
container and a count at the top of the page.

![Image updates](https://github.com/wjcloudy/homestead/releases/latest/download/homestead-image-updates.png)

**Update** pins the new image, watches the rollout (pulling, starting, ready),
and keeps the previous image so **Roll back** returns to exactly it. A registry
that cannot be checked is shown on that container only; the rest still show
their updates. **Settings → Updates** sets the policy: notify only, apply when
approved, or apply in a maintenance window. Updates never jump a major version
by themselves.

## Groups

Groups gather containers under a heading - Media, Home, Monitoring - that folds
away. **Group** in a container's menu puts it in one; **Groups** at the top of
the page ticks several at once. A chip per group shows that group alone.

Homestead's own containers - Homestead, the Samba that serves your shares, and
the backup storage for moves - start in a **Homestead** group, out of the way of
your apps.

## Privileges

Some apps need more of the host than containers get by default. A VPN client
such as transmission-openvpn or gluetun opens a tunnel and changes routes; without
permission it stops with:

```
RTNETLINK answers: Operation not permitted
```

**Privileges** in Deploy, Edit and Import:

| Option | Gives | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| **VPN tunnel** | the host's `/dev/net/tun` and `NET_ADMIN` | any VPN client - this is all it needs |
| **Extra capabilities** | named Linux capabilities, e.g. `NET_RAW`, `SYS_ADMIN` | an app whose docs list `--cap-add` |
| **Privileged** | everything the host has | a last resort, as on Unraid |

An Unraid template's Privileged switch and `--cap-add` / `--device=/dev/net/tun`
extra parameters fill these in by themselves, on install from the App Store and
on import.

## Hardware

A container given a hardware feature - an iGPU for transcoding, a Coral for
Frigate, a Zigbee stick for Zigbee2MQTT - gets the device, and is kept on a host
that has it. Features are named under **Settings → Hardware**; see
[Dashboard and nodes](Dashboard-and-nodes#hardware).

## Placement

**Where it runs** (in Edit, or **Placement** in the menu):

- **Spread instances** - its copies on different hosts, so losing one host does
  not take them all;
- **Run on the same node as** - kept with another app it talks to constantly;
- **Keep off the node of** - kept apart, like two DNS servers.

Each is a preference (steer, but start anyway) or a requirement (wait rather
than break it). The editor warns when a rule cannot be met.

## If a node fails

When a node stops answering, each container does one of three things -
**If a node fails** on Containers sets them all in one list, and each
container's editor has it under *Where it runs*:

| Choice | What happens |
|---|---|
| **Move to another node** | about 15 seconds later it starts on another node - for apps that should come back quickly wherever there is room. New containers start with this |
| **Wait for its node** | it stays with that node and starts again when the node is back - for apps tied to that host's hardware (a Coral, a Zigbee stick), or better restarted where they were |
| **Kubernetes default** | Kubernetes moves it after five minutes - what anything Homestead did not deploy has |

A container whose volume one node mounts at a time only really moves if
Longhorn lets go of the volume on the dead node. The dialog says whether it
will, and **Let Longhorn release them** sets Longhorn's *Pod Deletion Policy
When Node is Down* so it does; it is also under **Settings → Cluster**.
Changing a container's choice restarts it.

## Architecture

**Architecture** draws, for every app, the path from its address through its
Service to its pods, claims, Longhorn volumes and the replicas on each disk -
the quickest way to see what a failed disk or host would touch.
