# HarvUI

An Unraid-style control panel for a Harvester, Longhorn, and KubeVirt homelab.
HarvUI runs inside the cluster, talks directly to the Kubernetes API through a
dedicated ServiceAccount, and has no runtime framework or package downloads.

## Highlights

| Area | Capability |
|---|---|
| **Dashboard** | Cluster CPU/RAM/network/disk telemetry, node health, top consumers, configurable warnings |
| **Containers** | Deploy, edit, move, start/stop, logs, logos, hardware passthrough, image update checks, monitored rollout and deterministic rollback |
| **Architecture** | VIP → workload → claim → Longhorn volume → replica dependency view |
| **Storage** | RWO/RWX volume creation and growth, usage, health, snapshots, backups and recurring jobs |
| **Hardware** | Host device browser and reusable mappings for iGPU, Coral, USB/PCIe and other devices |
| **Import** | Unraid/Docker workload and appdata import with editable seed configuration |
| **Administration** | Viewer/operator/admin roles, appearance, thresholds, version and installation details |

## Container releases

Every `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` tag runs the full test suite and publishes an
`amd64`/`arm64` image to GitHub Container Registry with SBOM and provenance.
For a release such as `v1.9.2`, the workflow publishes:

```text
ghcr.io/wjcloudy/harvui:1.9.2
ghcr.io/wjcloudy/harvui:1.9
ghcr.io/wjcloudy/harvui:1
ghcr.io/wjcloudy/harvui:latest
ghcr.io/wjcloudy/harvui:sha-<commit>
```

The workflow authenticates with its short-lived `GITHUB_TOKEN`; no registry
password is stored in the repository. Create and publish a release with:

```bash
git tag v1.9.2
git push origin v1.9.2
```

The official package is public and can be pulled without registry credentials.
The OCI source label in the image links releases back to this repository.

## Fresh-cluster installation

### 1. Check Longhorn storage

HarvUI persists registry update history and cache on a 2 GiB Longhorn RWX
volume. Confirm the StorageClass used in `deploy/deploy.yaml` exists:

```bash
kubectl get storageclass
```

The supplied manifest uses `longhorn-r2`. Change `storageClassName` if the fresh
cluster uses another Longhorn class.

### 2. Configure and install

Review these values in `deploy/deploy.yaml` before applying it:

- `image`: published image/tag to run;
- `storageClassName`: Longhorn StorageClass;
- `LB_IP` and `kube-vip.io/loadbalancerIPs`: HarvUI's LAN address;
- `DEFAULT_NS`: default namespace for newly created workloads.

Then install and wait for readiness:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deploy/deploy.yaml
kubectl -n lab rollout status deployment/harvui --timeout=5m
kubectl -n lab get deployment/harvui pvc/harvui-data service/harvui
```

Open the Service address on port `8088`. The first visit creates the initial
administrator. Authentication is stored in a Kubernetes Secret, independently
of the container and Longhorn volume.

For a private fork/package, add an `imagePullSecrets` entry to the Deployment
and create a `docker-registry` secret using a classic GitHub token with only
`read:packages`. GitHub documents this in
[Working with the Container registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry).

### 3. Optional node telemetry

Kubernetes does not expose physical temperatures, host device inventory, or
per-disk throughput. Install the non-privileged node probe to enable those views:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deploy/nodeprobe.yaml
kubectl -n lab rollout status daemonset/harvui-nodeprobe --timeout=5m
```

The probe mounts `/sys`, `/proc`, and `/dev` read-only, drops all capabilities,
and uses a read-only root filesystem. HarvUI works without it.

## Updating HarvUI

HarvUI appears in its own Containers page. **Check images** compares the running
digest with GHCR, and a newer stable semver tag is suggested when one exists.
Installing the update pins the selected manifest digest, watches Deployment and
pod readiness, and keeps the previous digest for one-click rollback. The UI
automatically reconnects while HarvUI replaces itself.

Command-line deployment is also available:

```bash
TAG=1.9.2 HOST=rancher@192.168.1.210 ./scripts/deploy.sh
```

## Image update behaviour

- Public Docker Hub and OCI registries are checked anonymously.
- Private registries use only the workload's referenced `imagePullSecrets` (or
  its ServiceAccount pull secrets). Credentials never enter API responses or
  update-history files.
- Mutable tags such as `latest` are compared by digest.
- Stable `v1.2.3`/`1.2.3` images can move to the newest stable version in the
  same major release. Pre-releases and major-version jumps are not automatic.
- Multi-architecture index digests and their platform-specific child digests
  are treated as the same release, avoiding false update notifications.
- Rollback restores the exact previous digest rather than trusting a mutable tag.

## Configuration

| Environment variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `8080` | HTTP listen port |
| `WEBROOT` | `/web` | bundled static UI directory |
| `DATA_DIR` | `/data` | persistent update history/cache directory |
| `DEFAULT_NS` | `lab` | namespace for new workloads |
| `SMB_NAMESPACE` | `lab` | namespace containing the managed Samba deployment |
| `STORAGE_CLASS` | `longhorn-r2` | default StorageClass for new volumes |
| `LB_IP` | empty | shared kube-vip address |
| `SESSION_TTL_HOURS` | `12` | signed session lifetime |
| `ENABLE_NODE_POWER` | unset | `true` enables guarded reboot/shutdown actions |

## Local verification

The production image contains no build tools. CI performs the checks before the
image is published:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
for file in web/js/*.js; do node --check "$file"; done
docker build --build-arg VERSION=dev -t harvui:dev .
```

## Security notes

Passwords use PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 with per-user salts in the `harvui-auth`
Secret. Sessions are HMAC-signed, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict` cookies and all
mutations require a custom anti-CSRF header. Roles are enforced server-side.

The supplied Service is plain HTTP. Put it behind TLS before exposing HarvUI
outside a trusted LAN. Host power control is disabled by default because it
requires a short-lived privileged helper pod.
