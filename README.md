**Homestead is an open-source, NAS-style homelab dashboard and container
management UI for Harvester HCI, Rancher, Longhorn, Fleet, KubeVirt and
Kubernetes.** It runs inside your cluster, talks directly to the Kubernetes API
through a dedicated ServiceAccount, and turns workloads, storage, hardware
passthrough, image updates and failover constraints into approachable controls.

## Container releases

Every `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` tag runs the full test suite and publishes an
`amd64`/`arm64` image to GitHub Container Registry with SBOM and provenance.
For a release such as `v2.8.82`, the workflow publishes:

```text
ghcr.io/wjcloudy/homestead:2.8.82
ghcr.io/wjcloudy/homestead:2.8
ghcr.io/wjcloudy/homestead:2
ghcr.io/wjcloudy/homestead:latest
ghcr.io/wjcloudy/homestead:sha-<commit>
```

The workflow authenticates with its short-lived `GITHUB_TOKEN`; no registry
password is stored in the repository. Create and publish a release with:

```bash
git tag v2.8.82
git push origin v2.8.82
```

The official Homestead package is public and can be pulled without registry credentials.
The OCI source label in the image links releases back to this repository.

Each tagged release also launches Homestead against deterministic demo data,
captures polished Dashboard, Containers, Architecture, and Networking views in headless
Chromium, and attaches them to the GitHub release. The stable screenshot above
always follows the latest release; no live cluster data or credentials are used.

## Fresh-cluster installation

### 1. Check Longhorn storage

Homestead persists registry update history and cache on a 2 GiB Longhorn RWX
volume. A tightly scoped init container assigns that volume to Homestead's
non-root UID on first start; the application container itself remains
non-root with a read-only root filesystem. Confirm the StorageClass used in
`deploy/deploy.yaml` exists:

```bash
kubectl get storageclass
```

The supplied manifest uses `longhorn-r2`. Change `storageClassName` if the fresh
cluster uses another Longhorn class.

### 2. Configure and install

Review these values in `deploy/deploy.yaml` before applying it:

- `image`: published image/tag to run;
- `storageClassName`: Longhorn StorageClass;
- `LB_IP` and `kube-vip.io/loadbalancerIPs`: Homestead's LAN address;
- `DEFAULT_NS`: default namespace for newly created workloads.

Then install and wait for readiness:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deploy/deploy.yaml
kubectl -n lab rollout status deployment/homestead --timeout=5m
kubectl -n lab get deployment/homestead pvc/homestead-data service/homestead
```

Everything a new install creates is called `homestead`: the Deployment and its
containers, the ServiceAccount and roles, the `homestead-data` claim, the
Service, the ConfigMaps and Secrets it writes, and the `homestead.io/*`
annotation domain.

Open the Service address on port `8088`. The first visit creates the initial
administrator. Authentication is stored in a Kubernetes Secret, independently
of the container and Longhorn volume.

For a private fork/package, add an `imagePullSecrets` entry to the Deployment
and create a `docker-registry` secret using a classic GitHub token with only
`read:packages`. GitHub documents this in
[Working with the Container registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry).

### 3. Optional node telemetry and drive health

Kubernetes does not expose physical temperatures, host device inventory,
per-disk throughput, or SMART health. Install the node probe to enable those
views:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deploy/nodeprobe.yaml
kubectl -n lab rollout status daemonset/homestead-nodeprobe --timeout=5m
```

The ordinary telemetry container mounts `/sys`, `/proc`, and `/dev` read-only,
drops all capabilities, runs as a non-root user, and uses a read-only root
filesystem. An isolated `smart` sidecar runs `smartctl` against physical host
drives. Because generic Kubernetes cannot grant an unknown, changing set of
block devices individually, that sidecar alone is privileged; it still has no
host PID, IPC, or network namespace, uses a read-only root filesystem, and
accepts test requests only when they carry a short-lived signature from the
Homestead backend. Remove the sidecar if SMART access is not wanted—the normal
temperature, device, and throughput telemetry keeps working.

Node detail shows drive identity, capacity, temperature, SMART health, error
counters, power-on hours, and per-disk read/write MB/s. Administrators can run
short or extended self-tests after an explicit confirmation; tests and their
progress remain in Activity through browser refreshes and Homestead restarts.
Settings → Health thresholds controls temperature and media-error warnings.
USB/SATA bridges and virtual disks that do not expose SMART are labelled as
unsupported instead of being treated as failed drives.

Homestead works without either probe container. When the SMART sidecar is not
installed or cannot read a drive, the UI reports that state without degrading
the whole cluster.

### Import qcow2 and vmdk VM disks

Import → **VM disk** uses KubeVirt CDI to stream an HTTP(S) disk image into a
new Longhorn PVC. CDI auto-detects and converts common QEMU formats including
qcow2, vmdk, raw, vdi, vhd, and vhdx. Homestead checks both the DataVolume and
PVC name before starting and never overwrites an existing disk. Optional
SHA-256/SHA-512 verification, CDI credential Secrets, and private-CA ConfigMaps
are supported.

Download/conversion progress survives page refreshes and Homestead restarts in
the Activity tray. When the DataVolume reaches `Succeeded`, choose **Create VM**
to attach that exact disk without another copy. An imported RWO disk already
referenced by a VM is not offered for a second attachment. Source URLs (which
may contain signed query parameters) are intentionally excluded from Homestead's
inventory and operation-history responses; Kubernetes administrators can still
read the source from the DataVolume itself.

CDI must be installed in the cluster. Harvester includes it, and the supplied
RBAC permits Homestead to create and monitor DataVolumes while ordinary HTTP
credentials remain in namespace-scoped Kubernetes Secrets.

## App Store

The App Store reads the Community Applications catalogue - the templates behind
Unraid's Apps tab - and lists what can run as a container here. Plugins,
language packs and templates the catalogue has blacklisted, deprecated or
hidden are Unraid's own and are left out, so the listings match what Unraid
shows.

It opens on a front page laid out as Community Applications lays it out:

- **Spotlight** - the app the Unraid team picks each month, newest first, with
  the month and why it was picked;
- **Recently added** - the newest templates, in the order the feed added them;
- **Top trending** - the apps rising fastest in downloads;
- **Top performing** - the feed's best performers overall.

Each section has a page of its own, and search covers the whole catalogue.
Clicking an app opens its full page: the whole description, its maintainer and
whether the container is official, links to its project, support thread,
registry, read-me, video and Discord, the spotlight note, any comment from the
catalogue's moderators, what it requires, screenshots, and when it was added and
last updated. The same page shows Homestead's own review of the template - the
storage, network, dependency and hardware questions it will ask - before you
choose **Configure & deploy**.

### From template to workload

Homestead translates each template into Kubernetes ports, environment
variables, device hints, and explicit storage choices. Its compatibility
analyser is application-agnostic: port/protocol patterns determine network
intent, path and description semantics distinguish config/data/media/cache,
variable metadata identifies secrets, options, and external dependencies, and
requests for container-runtime sockets are blocked for a Kubernetes-specific
design. These rules apply to every catalogue image rather than a list of named
apps.

Public catalogue password defaults are discarded and regenerated locally.
Secret values are masked in manifest previews. Template option lists become
select controls, and the same storage, network, dependency, and hardware review
is used whether deployment begins in App Store or directly from Deploy. An image
given without a tag is deployed as `:latest`, which is what Docker would pull.
Plex, Pi-hole, and Nextcloud are release validation examples, not special-case
profiles.

### Choosing the catalogue

**Settings → App Store catalogue** points the App Store at any feed in the
Community Applications format - a mirror, or your own list of templates - and
**Use Community Applications** goes back to the public one. The App Store says
which feed it is reading. `COMMUNITY_CATALOG_URL` sets the default for a whole
deployment.

### Community catalogue data notice

The catalogue adapter reads the public Community Applications feed from
`Squidly271/AppFeed` at runtime, unless another feed is set; catalogue content
is not bundled into the Homestead image or repository. Requests identify
Homestead and results are cached for six hours. Homestead links to and credits
the upstream source, links each app to its own project and support pages, and
does not use Unraid logos or imply endorsement.

As of 20 September 2026, GitHub reports no declared repository license for the
`AppFeed` repository. The Community Applications plugin source contains GPLv2
headers, but that alone does not establish a license for generated feed metadata,
listing descriptions, or icons. Operators redistributing or commercially hosting
the catalogue should obtain permission from its maintainers/Lime Technology or
configure a feed whose reuse terms are explicit.

## Networking and virtual IPs

Networking reconciles Kubernetes Services, EndpointSlices, Ingresses, node
addresses, kube-vip status, and Harvester IP pools in one view. It shows the
live path from each VIP and listener through its Service to ready pod endpoints,
including the owning node and a direct access link where the protocol is
browser-friendly.

**Expose workload** creates either a cluster-only Service or a LAN-facing
LoadBalancer Service. Automatic allocation chooses an unused IPv4 address from
a visible Harvester IP pool; shared allocation reuses Homestead's VIP only when
the protocol/port tuple is free; manual allocation validates the address and
warns when it is outside the configured pools. Every flow shows a review plan
and collision check before Kubernetes is changed. Homestead deliberately
reconciles the pool against live Services and node addresses because a manually
requested kube-vip address may not be reflected in an IPPool's reported free
count.

The supplied RBAC is read-only for EndpointSlices, Ingresses, and Harvester IP
pools. Service creation uses the existing Service permission and copies the
selected Deployment's selector from the server rather than trusting browser
input.

## Cluster health and node onboarding

System → **Cluster** separates platform health from application health. It
shows the Harvester and Kubernetes versions, control-plane readiness, etcd
quorum and failure margin, node roles and pressure conditions, observed core
services, certificate-signing requests, and platform warning events from the
last 24 hours. Partial RBAC or API availability is reported per section instead
of hiding the rest of the page.

### Adding a host

**Add a host** on the Cluster page is a guide to Harvester's own installer.
An unattended install needs the new machine's install disk and network card
named in advance, and those are only known once the machine is in front of
you, so you choose them in the installer; the guide covers the rest:

1. **The ISO** - a direct link to the Harvester release this cluster runs, for
   its CPU architecture, with its checksums. Write it to a USB stick (Rufus in
   DD mode, or balenaEtcher) or mount it from the server's BMC.
2. **The cluster token** - Homestead never reads or stores it. The guide gives
   the two commands that print it on a management node, with that node's
   address filled in.
3. **Each installer screen** - join an existing cluster, the node role (with
   how many management nodes the cluster already has), disks, hostname (the
   next free name), management network, and the values Homestead reads from the
   cluster: its VIP, NTP servers and proxy.
4. **Watching it join** - the new host appears in the guide as soon as
   Harvester registers it, and again when it is Ready.

### Removing a host

**Remove from cluster** (host actions, or the cleanup list on the Cluster page)
checks first: a Ready node is refused, because a running node registers itself
again - maintenance mode and `rke2-uninstall.sh` on the host come first. Removing
the last control-plane node, or one without which etcd loses quorum, is refused;
volumes whose only healthy copy is on the node must be given up explicitly. It
then follows Harvester's order: Longhorn stops scheduling there, the Kubernetes
node is deleted (RKE2 drops its etcd membership), then its Cluster API machine,
then Longhorn's node record once no replicas are listed on it.

A host that is **gone for good** - dead and never coming back - can be removed
that way too. Nothing then waits on it: the pods and VMs still bound to it are
force-stopped so they start on other hosts, its volume attachments are
released so those volumes can attach elsewhere, the replica records Longhorn
keeps for it are deleted so it rebuilds them from the remaining copies, and a
Cluster API machine whose deletion hangs on the missing host has its finalizers
cleared. The Cluster page also lists leftovers - machines with no node or stuck
deleting, Longhorn nodes with no host - to delete, or force, one at a time.

Certificate monitoring is read-only. The supplied ClusterRole may list
Kubernetes certificate-signing requests but cannot approve them, and Homestead
never returns CSR bodies, issued certificates, or private keys to the browser.

## Publishing through a Cloudflare Tunnel

Homestead can deploy, delete, open shells in and power off anything in the
cluster, so treat a published hostname as a way into the whole cluster:

- **Put Cloudflare Access in front**, with an allow policy for named people and
  a second factor. Homestead's own sign-in stays on as the second lock.
- **Set `CF_ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN` and `CF_ACCESS_AUD`** on the Deployment. Homestead
  then checks Access's signature on every request that came through Cloudflare
  and refuses the rest, so an Access bypass rule or a policy on the wrong
  hostname does not quietly publish it.
- **Point the tunnel at the Service inside the cluster** -
  `http://homestead.lab.svc:8088` with the supplied manifest - not at the LAN
  VIP, and run `cloudflared` in the cluster.
- **Finish setup on the LAN first.** Creating the first administrator is refused
  through the tunnel.

Every response forbids framing and scripts from elsewhere, sessions are signed and
`Secure` behind TLS, requests over 8 MB are refused, and sign-in attempts are
limited per address and per account, using Cloudflare's client address rather
than a header the client can write.

## Installing the app and getting notifications

Opened over HTTPS — through a Cloudflare Tunnel, or a reverse proxy with a
certificate — Homestead can be installed as an app, and can notify each device
when something needs you, even with Homestead closed. Browsers offer neither on
a plain-HTTP LAN address; Settings says so there instead.

1. Open Homestead's `https://` address. Chrome and Edge offer **Install app** in
   Settings; on iPhone and iPad (iOS 16.4 or later), tap Share → **Add to Home
   Screen** and open Homestead from the Home Screen, since iOS delivers
   notifications only to installed web apps.
2. In **Settings → Notifications on this device**, choose **Turn on
   notifications** and pick what this device hears about:

| Kind | What it covers |
|---|---|
| Outages | a node not Ready, a volume faulted, a drive failing SMART |
| Degraded | a volume rebuilding a replica, a workload not ready after its start-up grace |
| Failed jobs | anything in the activity tray that ends in failure |
| Hosts joining | a new host registering with the cluster, and becoming Ready |
| Image updates | a newer image for a workload (off by default; checked every six hours) |

A problem is announced once it has lasted a minute, so restarts and rollouts do
not buzz a phone, and announced again when it is over; the second notification
replaces the first. **Send a test** checks the whole path.

How it works: pushes carry nothing. Encrypting a payload needs a crypto library
Homestead does not have, so Homestead sends an empty push signed with its VAPID
key (kept in `DATA_DIR`), and the app's service worker then fetches what
happened over its own signed-in connection. Nothing about the cluster passes
through Google's, Mozilla's or Apple's push service. If the session has expired,
the notification just says to open Homestead and sign in. Signing out on a
device stops its notifications; so does removing its user.

Homestead needs to reach the push services on the internet (for example
`fcm.googleapis.com`, `updates.push.services.mozilla.com`, `web.push.apple.com`,
`*.notify.windows.com`); it POSTs only to those hosts. Behind Cloudflare Access,
the manifest and icons are served without Access's signature so the browser can
install the app; if installation still fails, add an Access **Bypass** policy for
`/manifest.webmanifest` and `/icons/*`.

## Updating Homestead

Homestead appears in its own Containers page. **Check images** compares the running
digest with GHCR, and a newer stable semver tag is suggested when one exists.
Installing the update pins the selected manifest digest, watches Deployment and
pod readiness, and keeps the previous digest for one-click rollback. The UI
automatically reconnects while Homestead replaces itself.

Available updates and registry-check failures also appear in the global header
without repeated alert noise. Settings → Container image update policy supports
notify-only, explicit operator approval, or a UTC maintenance window. These
rules are enforced by the server, every rollout still requires acknowledgement,
and semantic-version discovery never silently crosses a major release. Image
pulls, updates, and rollbacks remain visible in the persistent Activity tray
through browser refreshes and Homestead restarts.

### Permissions look after themselves

The in-app update replaces Homestead's image, and a new release can need
permissions the old one did not. Homestead carries its manifest inside the image
and, on start, makes its own ClusterRole exactly what that release describes -
adding what new features need and dropping what nothing uses any more - so an
upgrade needs no `kubectl`. Rules added to that role by hand do not survive
this; give anything extra its own role and binding.
**Settings → About this installation → Permissions** says what it last did.

That needs the right to edit its own role, which an older install does not
have yet. Grant it once, wherever you use `kubectl` (a Rancher
**Kubectl Shell** will do):

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wjcloudy/homestead/v2.8.82/deploy/rbac.yaml
```

`deploy/rbac.yaml` holds only the permissions - the ServiceAccount, roles and
bindings from `deploy/deploy.yaml` - so it leaves your Deployment, Service,
address and storage alone. Settings shows this command whenever Homestead finds
it cannot update its role.

Command-line deployment is also available:

```bash
TAG=2.8.82 HOST=rancher@your-harvester-node ./scripts/deploy.sh
```

## Image update behaviour

- Public Docker Hub and OCI registries are checked anonymously.
- Private registries use only the workload's referenced `imagePullSecrets` (or
  its ServiceAccount pull secrets). Credentials never enter API responses or
  update-history files.
- Mutable tags such as `latest` are compared by digest.
- Stable `v1.2.3`/`1.2.3` images can move to the newest stable version in the
  same major release. Pre-releases and major-version jumps are not automatic.
- Multi-architecture index digests and their platform-specific child digests
  are treated as the same release, avoiding false update notifications.
- Rollback restores the exact previous digest rather than trusting a mutable tag.

## Image cache cleanup

Image Cache groups kubelet aliases by digest and labels images retained by a
running pod or the immediate managed-update rollback. Admins can remove an
unreferenced application digest from selected nodes after an impact preview and
typed confirmation. The backend rechecks live references immediately before
starting one short-lived cleanup pod per node; active, rollback, and recognized
Harvester/Kubernetes platform images are refused. Cleanup pods mount only the
host RKE2 `crictl` binary and containerd socket, run as root without Linux
capabilities or privilege escalation, and report progress through Activity.
Kubernetes Node status exposes only each node's largest cached images; smaller
entries may not appear in the table and Homestead will not attempt to remove them.

## Safe volume deletion

Volume deletion is available only to administrators and always starts with a
fresh impact preview. Homestead checks pods and workload controllers, VM disk
references, live Longhorn attachment, replica count, written data, snapshots,
external backups, and the PV reclaim policy. Any workload reference or active
attachment blocks deletion; Homestead never stops or rewrites a workload as a
side effect of deleting storage.

After a claim is detached and unreferenced, the administrator explicitly
chooses between deleting the PVC while forcing its PV to `Retain`, or permanently
deleting the PVC and backing Longhorn data with the PV policy set to `Delete`.
The exact claim name must be typed before either action. System namespaces and
Homestead's own `homestead-data` claim are protected, and the supplied RBAC grants
only the additional PV `patch` permission required to make the chosen reclaim
behavior deterministic.

## Restore a Longhorn backup

Completed backups have a **Restore** action in Data Protection. Homestead always
restores into a newly named PVC: it checks the namespace and destination name
first, refuses to overwrite an existing claim, and enforces a capacity at least
as large as the backed-up volume. RWO and RWX claims are supported, with an
explicit replica count.

The restore uses Longhorn's documented CSI `fromBackup` StorageClass parameter.
Homestead creates a deterministic, reusable restore class derived from the
backup URL and selected replica count, then submits an ordinary PVC to the
Longhorn CSI provisioner. It never fabricates a PV or mutates the source volume
or backup. The Activity tray persists the operation and reports provisioning,
per-replica restore percentage, replica-health waiting, and actionable Longhorn
errors across browser or Homestead restarts. See the
[Longhorn StorageClass parameters](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.12.1/references/storage-class-parameters/)
reference for the underlying mechanism.

## Moving workloads between clusters

A container or VM can move from one Harvester cluster to another when both run
Homestead. The destination does the work: it asks the other Homestead for the
workload's definition directly, and reads its volumes from the Longhorn backups
the other cluster wrote, so the source never holds credentials for the
destination.

1. **Give the source cluster backup storage.** Data Protection ▸ **Set up
   storage** runs MinIO on a Longhorn volume and points Longhorn's backups at it.
   Give it a LAN address, or the other cluster cannot read from it. It shares
   fate with the cluster it protects: it is for moving workloads, not for your
   only copy of anything.
2. **On the destination, add the source.** Import ▸ **＋ Homestead cluster**
   takes the other Homestead's address (for example `http://192.168.1.242:8088`)
   and a Homestead account there - not a Harvester or SSH login; operator is
   enough to browse, a move needs admin. The password is kept in a Secret. The
   cluster's card shows the other Homestead's release and whether the two can
   move workloads between them - and which side to update if not; different
   releases that speak the same move protocol work together.
3. **Browse and move.** **Browse workloads** lists what the other cluster runs,
   with the reason anything cannot move (for example a ConfigMap, Secret or
   host-path volume, which Homestead did not write and cannot rebuild). **Move to this
   cluster** reviews the namespace, address and storage here, and lists every
   blocker and warning from both clusters before anything stops.

The move stops the workload there, backs up its volumes, restores them here,
creates the workload and starts it, following each step in Activity. If the two
clusters use different backup targets, this cluster's Longhorn target is pointed
at the source's bucket, and the review says so first. The move survives a
restart of either Homestead and has no timeout that would abandon a large
volume. The original stays on the source, stopped, until you remove it, so it
can be put back at any point.

## Importing from Unraid

An Unraid container usually maps several host folders, and they do not all
belong in the same place: appdata wants a small replicated claim, recordings or
media want a large one. An import can therefore fill **several volumes at
once** — define the volumes, then point each folder at the one it belongs to.
A folder sharing a volume with others is copied into its own subdirectory; a
folder that has a volume to itself takes its root. Either way it is mounted
back at the path the container expects, through `subPath`, and the workload
ends up with one volume entry per claim rather than one per folder.

App Store installs lay an app out the same way: the paths an Unraid template
maps into appdata share one `<app>-appdata` volume, each in a folder named
after its path, sized for all of them. Media stays for you to point at a
library, and cache stays scratch space. Any storage row in the deploy wizard or
the container editor has a **Folder in volume** field, so the same layout can
be built by hand: give two rows the same new volume name and the second
becomes another folder in it.

The container editor can also restructure storage after the fact — combine two
volumes into folders of one, split a folder out to a volume of its own, or
rename a folder. When a path moves, the editor offers to bring its data: the
save is applied with the container stopped, a job copies each old location to
its new one (keeping owners and times), and the container starts again. The old
volumes are only read, never deleted, so pointing the paths back undoes it;
remove them from Volumes once you are happy. Progress is in the job tray, and
the steps carry on from where they were if Homestead restarts part-way.

The same RAM-backed volume is offered wherever storage is chosen — the deploy
wizard, the container editor and the import form all share one picker — so an
app that wants a cache in memory can have one without being imported first.

A tmpfs mount is not copied at all. On Unraid, Frigate's `/tmp/cache` is a RAM
disk that starts empty every boot, so it imports as a memory-backed `emptyDir`
of the same size rather than as a claim full of last week's cache: the same
speed and the same volatility, capped so it cannot eat a node's memory. They
used to be dropped silently, leaving the container to write cache onto its own
filesystem.

Measure sizes runs `du` on the source under a per-folder timeout, fills in each
volume's size from what is actually there, and lets the copy report progress in
bytes rather than folder counts. The capacity check is per volume, so a 500 GiB
recordings claim never excuses appdata that will not fit.

The copy preserves ownership and permissions by number, so an imported app
finds its appdata exactly as it left it on the source. Ownership can be
overridden during an import, for a container that should run as a different
user here than it did there. For appdata imported by an older release, which
arrived owned by root, Volumes has an **Ownership** action that hands an
existing claim to a user, filled in from whatever mounts the volume — PUID and
PGID first, then a container or pod security context — so the number is never
a guess.

## Importing a Docker Compose file

Import ▸ **Docker Compose** (also on the Deploy page) takes a pasted
`docker-compose.yml` in the same editor Volumes uses for files, and checks it as
you type. Problems are underlined on the line they are about, and each service
shows what it will become before anything is created. A `.env` file pasted
under Variables fills `${NAME}`, `${NAME:-default}` and the other forms Compose
understands.

Each service becomes its own workload, created in `depends_on` order:

- a named volume becomes a new Longhorn claim of that name, or uses the claim
  already there; one that several services mount is created as shared (RWX);
- a host folder such as `./config` becomes a new claim too, because a pod can
  land on any node. Its current contents are not copied; Import ▸ Container
  source brings data across;
- `tmpfs` and `shm_size` become RAM disks, and devices are matched to hardware
  features;
- a service other services reach by name, such as a database, gets an address
  inside the cluster so that name keeps working;
- `entrypoint`, `command`, `working_dir`, a numeric `user` and `cap_add` carry
  across. Reservations become requests; limits are not enforced.

Some things are refused outright: `build` without an `image`, the Docker socket,
`secrets`/`configs`, and a device no hardware feature covers. Docker-only
settings such as `labels` and `logging` are listed as left out. **Edit in form**
opens one service in the Deploy form to change anything first; **Create
workloads** reads the file again on the server and creates every service,
stopping at the first failure and saying what was already made.

## Editing files on a volume

A claim's contents are only reachable from a pod that mounts it, so Volumes ▸
Files starts a short-lived helper pod, lists directories through it and opens
text files in an editor. The pod gives itself a thirty-minute deadline and is
removed when the browser is closed, because while it runs it holds the claim —
which also means a ReadWriteOnce volume cannot be browsed until the workload
using it is stopped, and the error says so.

Saving is two steps: the content is written to a temporary file, its length is
compared with what was sent, and only a complete write replaces the original,
with the previous contents kept alongside as `<name>.homestead-bak`. JSON is
parsed and YAML is checked for tab indentation before a save; either complaint
can be overridden, because it is your file. Binary files and anything above
1 MB are listed but not editable, and no path can address anything outside the
volume.

Files open in Monaco — the editor from VS Code — with highlighting for YAML,
JSON, INI, XML, shell, Markdown and the rest of what turns up in appdata, plus
JSON validation as you type and Ctrl/Cmd+S to save. It is the one third-party
library in the browser UI, vendored at `web/vendor/monaco` as a trimmed 4.5 MB
subset of the 14 MB distribution, fetched only when a file is opened and never
on page load. If it cannot load at all the editor falls back to a plain
textarea, which saves through exactly the same path.

`server/homestead_files.py` holds the server side, reusing the exec WebSocket the
console already speaks.

## Storage classes

A StorageClass is the recipe Longhorn follows when it creates a volume.
Kubernetes fixes a class at creation — its parameters, provisioner and reclaim
policy cannot be edited afterwards — so Homestead offers create, make-default
and delete rather than an edit button that would silently do nothing. Deleting
a class is refused while any claim still references it, and volumes already
built from it keep working and keep their data.

A volume that is not healthy says why, taken from Longhorn's own conditions:
most often that a replica cannot be scheduled because no node has room for it.
A volume that is merely rebuilding says so too, along with the fact that it is
readable and writable meanwhile, because "degraded" on its own reads like an
emergency when usually it is not.

Choosing an existing claim shows what Longhorn knows about it — its access
mode, size, replica health and the node it is currently attached to — because
`Bound` says nothing about whether a second pod on another node can mount it.
Two cases are called out by name: a ReadWriteOnce claim already attached
elsewhere cannot attach twice, and a claim from a migratable class answers a
second node by starting a live migration rather than attaching, which the CSI
driver will not filesystem-mount while it is in flight.

One parameter decides whether a class can back container storage at all.
A class with `migratable: true` hands out two-controller volumes so a VM disk
can live-migrate between hosts, and Longhorn's CSI driver refuses to
filesystem-mount those into a pod: a ReadWriteMany claim created on such a
class binds happily and then strands whatever tries to use it in
`ContainerCreating`. Homestead therefore refuses ReadWriteMany claims on a
migratable class, naming the classes that would work, and the storage picker
narrows its class list as soon as RWX is chosen. Harvester's reserved internal
classes are never offered.

A deletion is refused while something would break: a running pod, or a
controller that still references the claim even at zero replicas, since it
would start one day and find nothing. A Job that has finished, and the pod it
left behind, are listed but do not block - the copy job from an import used to
trap the volume it had just filled. Homestead removes its own finished jobs
before deleting the claim, because Kubernetes can otherwise hold the PVC in
Terminating while one exists. A transfer can also be cleared from Import
directly: a running copy is cancelled, a failed or finished one is removed.
Because a failed import usually leaves a stopped workload and a half-filled
volume behind, removing it offers to delete those too — the volume only when
that import created it, since a claim it merely copied into belongs to
whatever was using it before.

## Network shares

Network Shares manages the existing `samba` Deployment and Longhorn-backed
claims without replacing their data. A new share either creates its own
Longhorn claim or publishes a volume that already exists — including one a
container is using — optionally narrowed to a single folder inside it, so
appdata can be reached from Windows without copying it. Two shares on one claim
mount it once and differ only by folder. A share can be grown in place, switched
between guest and private access, assigned a username, and made read-only or
read/write. Longhorn/Kubernetes claims cannot shrink, so the editor shows the
live PVC request as its minimum size; a borrowed volume is resized from
Volumes instead, never by the share. Size-only changes do not restart Samba;
access-policy changes use the Activity tray to follow the rolling restart.

Samba serves every share from one pod with the Recreate strategy, because its
claims are mostly ReadWriteOnce. A share whose volume cannot be mounted would
therefore take every working share down with it, so a change is guarded: the
claim must be Bound and mountable before the Deployment is written, and if the
pod does not become ready the previous shares are restored and the change is
refused with the mount error. The guard only reverts when Samba was serving
beforehand, so a repair still applies to an already-broken Samba.

A password belongs to the Samba account, not to one share, because Samba keeps
a single password per user. A second private share for an existing username
therefore reuses that account's password when the field is left blank —
Homestead never shows a stored password back, so it cannot ask you to retype
one — and setting a new password changes it for every share using that
account, which the editor says before you save. Passwords that disagreed about
the same account used to fail validation on every later change, including
changes to unrelated shares.

Share metadata is stored in the `homestead-shares` ConfigMap. Passwords are stored
separately in the `homestead-share-credentials` Kubernetes Secret and are never
returned by the Homestead API. The first successful share edit transparently
migrates credentials from older Homestead ConfigMaps and the existing Samba
arguments. Removing a share keeps its PVC and data.

## Namespaces

A Harvester cluster holds dozens of namespaces that belong to Harvester,
Rancher, Longhorn and Kubernetes - several named after generated IDs - and none
of them is a place for an app. Every namespace picker in Homestead (Deploy,
Import, Compose, Volumes, Data Protection) offers only yours. A namespace is
treated as the platform's by name (`kube-*`, `cattle-*`, `harvester-*`,
`longhorn-*`, `fleet-*` and the like), by the IDs Rancher generates (`p-xxxxx`,
`u-xxxxx`, `user-xxxxx`), or by the annotation Rancher sets on the namespaces it
considers its own.

**Settings → Namespaces** lists yours with what each holds - apps, stateful
sets, volumes and VMs - and how many platform namespaces are hidden. An admin
can create a namespace there, and delete one only when it is empty and its name
is typed; `default`, the namespace new workloads go to (`DEFAULT_NS`), and the
one Homestead runs in are kept. A namespace that Homestead created is labelled
`homestead.io/managed`.

## Container groups

Workloads can be gathered into groups - Media, Home, Monitoring, whatever suits
- from **Group** in a container's menu, or **Groups** on the Containers page to
tick several and move them at once. Containers then shows each group under a
divider that folds, ungrouped workloads last, and a chip per group shows that
one alone; the search box matches group names too. Sorting a column sorts
within each group. A group is the `homestead.io/group` annotation on each
Deployment, so it needs no list of its own and exists while something is in it.

## Workload logos

Container create, edit, import, and App Store flows accept an optional public
HTTP(S) raster-image URL. Before changing the workload, Homestead validates the
destination, blocks private/link-local address resolution and credentialed
URLs, limits the response to 256 KiB, and stores the verified image by content
hash under `$DATA_DIR/icons`. Deployments keep both the same-origin cached URL
and the original source annotation, so cards do not depend on the remote host
and the source remains editable. SVG is deliberately not accepted. Cached
content-addressed image paths are public so browser image loads do not depend
on session cookies; workload data and original source annotations remain
authenticated.

## Configuration

| Environment variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `8080` | HTTP listen port |
| `WEBROOT` | `/web` | bundled static UI directory |
| `DATA_DIR` | `/data` | persistent operation history, audit, and workload-icon cache directory |
| `DEFAULT_NS` | `lab` | namespace for new workloads |
| `SMB_NAMESPACE` | `lab` | namespace containing the managed Samba deployment |
| `STORAGE_CLASS` | `longhorn-r2` | default StorageClass for new volumes |
| `LB_IP` | empty | shared kube-vip address |
| `SESSION_TTL_HOURS` | `12` | idle window for an ordinary session |
| `SESSION_REMEMBER_DAYS` | `30` | idle window when "keep me signed in" is ticked |
| `SESSION_MAX_DAYS` | `90` | hard limit on a session's age, however active |
| `ENABLE_NODE_POWER` | unset | `true` enables guarded reboot/shutdown actions |
| `COMMUNITY_CATALOG_URL` | AppFeed | the App Store's default catalogue feed; Settings can override it |
| `FILES_IMAGE` | `alpine:3.20` | image of the helper pod that browses and edits files on a volume |
| `FILES_SESSION_SECONDS` | `1800` | how long that helper pod may live |
| `CF_ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN`, `CF_ACCESS_AUD` | empty | require Cloudflare Access's signature on requests through a tunnel |
| `PUSH_CONTACT` | project URL | the `mailto:` or `https:` contact push services see in Homestead's VAPID token |

## Local verification

The production image contains no build tools. CI performs the checks before the
image is published:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
for file in web/js/*.js web/sw.js; do node --check "$file"; done
node --test tests/*.test.js
docker build --build-arg VERSION=dev -t homestead:dev .
```

## Security notes

Passwords use PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 with per-user salts in the `homestead-auth`
Secret. Sessions are HMAC-signed, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict` cookies and all
mutations require a custom anti-CSRF header. Roles are enforced server-side.
Every response carries a Content Security Policy that forbids framing and
scripts from elsewhere; sign-in attempts are limited per address and per
account; request bodies over 8 MB are refused.

### Drive health

Each drive carries a verdict — healthy, needs attention, critical, or not
reported — drawn from its SMART counters against the thresholds in **Settings →
Drive health policy**, not from the drive's own overall-health bit, which reads
PASSED until failure is imminent. Where a drive reports a measure of remaining
life it is shown as a percentage: NVMe endurance used, a SATA SSD's life-left
attribute, or failing both, how close the worst pre-failure attribute sits to
its manufacturer threshold. A drive that reports no such figure shows nothing
rather than a made-up number.

The probe's scripts travel inside the Homestead image. On start, Homestead
compares them with the ones the installed probe is running and replaces them if
they differ, restarting the DaemonSet — so upgrading Homestead upgrades the
probe, with no manifest to re-apply. It updates whichever name the probe already
has, and never installs one that is not there: the SMART sidecar is privileged,
so installing one is asked for: **Install node probe** on a node with no
thermal data, or from **Settings → About this installation**, which also shows
what the last check decided and offers to remove it again. `kubectl apply -f
deploy/nodeprobe.yaml` still works for anyone who prefers it.

`deploy/nodeprobe.yaml` is generated from `server/homestead_probe.py` and the
scripts in `server/probe/`, so the manifest applied by hand and the objects
Homestead installs itself are the same objects. Run
`python scripts/render_nodeprobe.py` after changing either; a test fails if they
disagree.

### Naming an installation

The line under the Homestead wordmark, and the footer on a phone, show whatever
**Settings → About this installation → Site name** is set to, alongside the
running version. It starts blank, in which case only the version is shown.

### Sessions

A session has two clocks. The **idle window** is how long it survives with
nothing happening, and it restarts whenever the session is used — so nobody is
signed out in the middle of a task. The **absolute window** is how long a
session may live at all, and it does not restart, so a cookie copied off a
machine stops working whatever the holder does with it.

| | idle | absolute |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ordinary sign-in | 12 hours | 90 days |
| "keep me signed in" | 30 days | 90 days |

The cookie is refreshed once a session passes the halfway point of its idle
window, so an open browser is not handed a new one on every request. `Secure`
is set when the request arrived over TLS, directly or through a proxy that sets
`X-Forwarded-Proto`; it is left off over plain HTTP, where a `Secure` cookie
would never be sent back.

Long sessions are safe because they stay revocable. Every token carries the
account's version number, checked against the stored record on each request, so
changing a password or using **Sign out everywhere** invalidates every session
for that account immediately, on every device. The role is re-read from the
store rather than trusted from the token, so a demotion takes effect at once
rather than at the next sign-in.

Homestead's ClusterRole lets it update that role itself (with Kubernetes'
`escalate` verb), so each release can bring the permissions it needs. That is,
in effect, cluster-admin; so is starting privileged pods with host access, which
the node probe, image cleanup and node power already do. The right is limited
by name to Homestead's own role and binding.

Interactive container consoles require operator access. The supplied manifest
grants `pods/exec` only through the `homestead-console` Role in the `lab`
namespace—not through the cluster-wide role. The proxy independently restricts
sessions to `DEFAULT_NS`, validates the exact running pod and application
container, checks the browser origin, and keeps the service-account token on the
server. Session start/stop metadata is written to
`$DATA_DIR/console-audit.jsonl`; terminal input and output are not recorded.

The supplied Service is plain HTTP. Put it behind TLS before exposing Homestead
outside a trusted LAN - see [Publishing through a Cloudflare
Tunnel](#publishing-through-a-cloudflare-tunnel). Host power control is disabled
by default because it requires a short-lived privileged helper pod.
