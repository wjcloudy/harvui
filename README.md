# HarvUI

An Unraid-style control panel for a Harvester, Longhorn, and KubeVirt homelab.
HarvUI runs inside the cluster, talks directly to the Kubernetes API through a
dedicated ServiceAccount, and has no runtime framework or package downloads.

## Container releases

Every `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` tag runs the full test suite and publishes an
`amd64`/`arm64` image to GitHub Container Registry with SBOM and provenance.
For a release such as `v1.10.0`, the workflow publishes:

```text
ghcr.io/wjcloudy/harvui:1.10.0
ghcr.io/wjcloudy/harvui:1.10
ghcr.io/wjcloudy/harvui:1
ghcr.io/wjcloudy/harvui:latest
ghcr.io/wjcloudy/harvui:sha-<commit>
```

The workflow authenticates with its short-lived `GITHUB_TOKEN`; no registry
password is stored in the repository. Create and publish a release with:

```bash
git tag v1.10.0
git push origin v1.10.0
```

The official package is public and can be pulled without registry credentials.
The OCI source label in the image links releases back to this repository.

## Fresh-cluster installation

### 1. Check Longhorn storage

HarvUI persists registry update history and cache on a 2 GiB Longhorn RWX
volume. A tightly scoped init container assigns that volume to HarvUI's
non-root UID on first start; the application container itself remains
non-root with a read-only root filesystem. Confirm the StorageClass used in
`deploy/deploy.yaml` exists:

```bash
kubectl get storageclass
```

The supplied manifest uses `longhorn-r2`. Change `storageClassName` if the fresh
cluster uses another Longhorn class.

### 2. Configure and install

Review these values in `deploy/deploy.yaml` before applying it:

- `image`: published image/tag to run;
- `storageClassName`: Longhorn StorageClass;
- `LB_IP` and `kube-vip.io/loadbalancerIPs`: HarvUI's LAN address;
- `DEFAULT_NS`: default namespace for newly created workloads.

Then install and wait for readiness:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deploy/deploy.yaml
kubectl -n lab rollout status deployment/harvui --timeout=5m
kubectl -n lab get deployment/harvui pvc/harvui-data service/harvui
```

Open the Service address on port `8088`. The first visit creates the initial
administrator. Authentication is stored in a Kubernetes Secret, independently
of the container and Longhorn volume.

For a private fork/package, add an `imagePullSecrets` entry to the Deployment
and create a `docker-registry` secret using a classic GitHub token with only
`read:packages`. GitHub documents this in
[Working with the Container registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry).

### 3. Optional node telemetry

Kubernetes does not expose physical temperatures, host device inventory, or
per-disk throughput. Install the non-privileged node probe to enable those views:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deploy/nodeprobe.yaml
kubectl -n lab rollout status daemonset/harvui-nodeprobe --timeout=5m
```

The probe mounts `/sys`, `/proc`, and `/dev` read-only, drops all capabilities,
and uses a read-only root filesystem. HarvUI works without it.

## Updating HarvUI

HarvUI appears in its own Containers page. **Check images** compares the running
digest with GHCR, and a newer stable semver tag is suggested when one exists.
Installing the update pins the selected manifest digest, watches Deployment and
pod readiness, and keeps the previous digest for one-click rollback. The UI
automatically reconnects while HarvUI replaces itself.

Available updates and registry-check failures also appear in the global header
without repeated alert noise. Settings → Container image update policy supports
notify-only, explicit operator approval, or a UTC maintenance window. These
rules are enforced by the server, every rollout still requires acknowledgement,
and semantic-version discovery never silently crosses a major release. Image
pulls, updates, and rollbacks remain visible in the persistent Activity tray
through browser refreshes and HarvUI restarts.

Command-line deployment is also available:

```bash
TAG=1.15.5 HOST=rancher@192.168.1.210 ./scripts/deploy.sh
```

## Image update behaviour

- Public Docker Hub and OCI registries are checked anonymously.
- Private registries use only the workload's referenced `imagePullSecrets` (or
  its ServiceAccount pull secrets). Credentials never enter API responses or
  update-history files.
- Mutable tags such as `latest` are compared by digest.
- Stable `v1.2.3`/`1.2.3` images can move to the newest stable version in the
  same major release. Pre-releases and major-version jumps are not automatic.
- Multi-architecture index digests and their platform-specific child digests
  are treated as the same release, avoiding false update notifications.
- Rollback restores the exact previous digest rather than trusting a mutable tag.

## Image cache cleanup

Image Cache groups kubelet aliases by digest and labels images retained by a
running pod or the immediate managed-update rollback. Admins can remove an
unreferenced application digest from selected nodes after an impact preview and
typed confirmation. The backend rechecks live references immediately before
starting one short-lived cleanup pod per node; active, rollback, and recognized
Harvester/Kubernetes platform images are refused. Cleanup pods mount only the
host RKE2 `crictl` binary and containerd socket, run as root without Linux
capabilities or privilege escalation, and report progress through Activity.
Kubernetes Node status exposes only each node's largest cached images; smaller
entries may not appear in the table and HarvUI will not attempt to remove them.

## Workload logos

Container create, edit, import, and App Store flows accept an optional public
HTTP(S) raster-image URL. Before changing the workload, HarvUI validates the
destination, blocks private/link-local address resolution and credentialed
URLs, limits the response to 256 KiB, and stores the verified image by content
hash under `$DATA_DIR/icons`. Deployments keep both the same-origin cached URL
and the original source annotation, so cards do not depend on the remote host
and the source remains editable. SVG is deliberately not accepted. Cached
content-addressed image paths are public so browser image loads do not depend
on session cookies; workload data and original source annotations remain
authenticated.

## Configuration

| Environment variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `8080` | HTTP listen port |
| `WEBROOT` | `/web` | bundled static UI directory |
| `DATA_DIR` | `/data` | persistent operation history, audit, and workload-icon cache directory |
| `DEFAULT_NS` | `lab` | namespace for new workloads |
| `SMB_NAMESPACE` | `lab` | namespace containing the managed Samba deployment |
| `STORAGE_CLASS` | `longhorn-r2` | default StorageClass for new volumes |
| `LB_IP` | empty | shared kube-vip address |
| `SESSION_TTL_HOURS` | `12` | signed session lifetime |
| `ENABLE_NODE_POWER` | unset | `true` enables guarded reboot/shutdown actions |

## Local verification

The production image contains no build tools. CI performs the checks before the
image is published:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
for file in web/js/*.js; do node --check "$file"; done
docker build --build-arg VERSION=dev -t harvui:dev .
```

## Security notes

Passwords use PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 with per-user salts in the `harvui-auth`
Secret. Sessions are HMAC-signed, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict` cookies and all
mutations require a custom anti-CSRF header. Roles are enforced server-side.

Interactive container consoles require operator access. The supplied manifest
grants `pods/exec` only through the `harvui-console` Role in the `lab`
namespace—not through the cluster-wide role. The proxy independently restricts
sessions to `DEFAULT_NS`, validates the exact running pod and application
container, checks the browser origin, and keeps the service-account token on the
server. Session start/stop metadata is written to
`$DATA_DIR/console-audit.jsonl`; terminal input and output are not recorded.

The supplied Service is plain HTTP. Put it behind TLS before exposing HarvUI
outside a trusted LAN. Host power control is disabled by default because it
requires a short-lived privileged helper pod.
